Introdution
=============

I create this doc in order to provide ordered, collected and detailed, information about football (soccer) analytics for research works and interesting stuff, activated by `NBAStuffer-Analytics-101 <https://www.nbastuffer.com/analytics-101/>`_. Collected information will be updated step-by-step, if you have any idea or new findings, feel free to commit to this doc or contact me via the email shown on my github.

So far, I have collected informations from the following aspects:

- :ref:`data`: Useful public data source, some are free while others must be bought from data companies.

- :ref:`lessons`: Helpful lessons of Sports Analytics and interesting research papers published on important AI conference and MIT Slogan Sports Analytics Conference Conference.

- :ref:`company`: Football analytics companies, including general analytics companies that cover other sports. These companies are mainly data collectors, statistical analyzers and special solution providers. Companies using AI (Artificial Intelligence) are valued much more. Related product demo vediosa are also contained.

- :ref:`reference`: Some useful reference webpages that provide interesting analytics information on other sports, like basketball, American football, lacrosse, baseball and others.
